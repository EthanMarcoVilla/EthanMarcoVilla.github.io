## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

*Lab 09
This lab is most familiar because it works with navigating strings and comparing them to each other. It reminds me of the Java class i took where we did a lot of code involving manipulating strings.

*Lab 10
I like this lab because the first part introduced me to files and their inputs. The second part I find very important as it shows 2D vectors and how to use them. As well as how to navigate them and extract data from them. It gave me a great understanding of how a lot of programs work; that are used on a daily basis.

*Lab 11
This is my favorite lab as in the first part I learned how to make code that utilizes files. I love learning how to connect code to external concepts. As well as making objects and learning how they work. The second part gave me a better understanding on how constructors work as well as accessors. I have been having a tough time understanding how to make them properly and this assignment in particular helped and now I can confidently say I am comfortable with them.
